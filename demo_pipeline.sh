# F1 Scuderia Picker Bot - CI/CD Pipeline Demo Script
# This script demonstrates how the branch protection and CI/CD pipeline work

echo "🏎️ F1 Scuderia Picker Bot - CI/CD Pipeline Demo"
echo "==============================================="
echo ""

echo "📋 Current CI/CD Pipeline Status:"
echo "  ✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured (.github/workflows/test.yml)"
echo "  ✅ Pre-commit hooks available (.pre-commit-config.yaml)"
echo "  ✅ Branch protection documentation (BRANCH_PROTECTION.md)"
echo "  ✅ Development dependencies (requirements-dev.txt)"
echo "  ✅ Comprehensive test suite (15+ tests)"
echo ""

echo "🔄 Pipeline Jobs Overview:"
echo "  1. 'Validate Code' - Syntax checks, import validation (fast fail)"
echo "  2. 'Test Suite (Python 3.9-3.12)' - Comprehensive testing across versions"
echo "  3. 'Security & Quality' - Bandit, Safety, Flake8, Black, isort"
echo "  4. 'Integration Tests' - End-to-end unique driver constraint testing"
echo "  5. 'All Checks Passed ✅' - Final merge gate (ALL jobs must pass)"
echo ""

echo "🛡️ Branch Protection (when configured):"
echo "  ❌ Direct pushes to main branch BLOCKED"
echo "  ❌ Merges without passing tests BLOCKED"
echo "  ❌ Merges with security issues BLOCKED"
echo "  ❌ Merges with linting errors BLOCKED"
echo "  ✅ Merges only allowed after ALL checks pass"
echo ""

echo "🚀 To Enable Branch Protection:"
echo ""
echo "Option 1 - Using GitHub CLI (Quick):"
echo "  gh auth login"
echo "  gh api repos/gercamjr/f1-scuderia-picker-discord-bot/branches/main/protection \\"
echo "    --method PUT \\"
echo "    --field required_status_checks='{\"strict\":true,\"contexts\":[\"All Checks Passed ✅\"]}' \\"
echo "    --field enforce_admins=true \\"
echo "    --field required_pull_request_reviews='{\"required_approving_review_count\":0,\"dismiss_stale_reviews\":true}' \\"
echo "    --field restrictions=null"
echo ""
echo "Option 2 - Manual via GitHub Web:"
echo "  1. Go to: https://github.com/gercamjr/f1-scuderia-picker-discord-bot/settings/branches"
echo "  2. Click 'Add rule'"
echo "  3. Branch name pattern: main"
echo "  4. ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging"
echo "  5. ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging"
echo "  6. Select 'All Checks Passed ✅' as required status check"
echo "  7. ✅ Include administrators"
echo "  8. Save changes"
echo ""

echo "🧪 Testing the Pipeline:"
echo ""
echo "# Test 1: Create feature branch and make breaking change"
echo "git checkout -b feature/test-pipeline"
echo "echo 'invalid_syntax(' >> bot.py"
echo "git add . && git commit -m 'Test: break syntax'"
echo "git push origin feature/test-pipeline"
echo "gh pr create --title 'Test Pipeline' --body 'Testing CI/CD pipeline'"
echo "# Result: CI will fail, PR cannot be merged ❌"
echo ""

echo "# Test 2: Fix the issue"
echo "git checkout bot.py"
echo "git commit -m 'Fix: restore valid syntax'"  
echo "git push"
echo "# Result: CI will pass, PR can be merged ✅"
echo ""

echo "🎯 What Happens When Tests Fail:"
echo "  - GitHub shows red X next to commit"
echo "  - Pull request shows 'Some checks haven't completed yet'"
echo "  - Merge button is disabled/grayed out"
echo "  - Clear error messages explain what failed"
echo "  - Developers must fix issues before merge is allowed"
echo ""

echo "✅ What Happens When All Tests Pass:"
echo "  - GitHub shows green checkmark next to commit"
echo "  - Pull request shows 'All checks have passed'"
echo "  - Merge button becomes available"
echo "  - Code can be safely merged into main branch"
echo ""

echo "📊 Pipeline Features:"
echo "  🔄 Runs automatically on every push and PR"
echo "  ⚡ Fast failure for quick feedback (validate job runs first)"
echo "  🔄 Caching for faster builds"
echo "  🛡️ Security scanning with Bandit and Safety"
echo "  📝 Code quality enforcement with Flake8, Black, isort"
echo "  🧪 Comprehensive test coverage (15+ test cases)"
echo "  🏎️ Unique driver constraint verification"
echo "  📈 Testing across Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12"
echo "  📋 Detailed reporting and artifact uploads"
echo ""

echo "🏁 Result: Bulletproof main branch!"
echo "   No broken code can ever be merged 🚫"
echo "   All features are thoroughly tested ✅"
echo "   Security vulnerabilities are caught 🛡️"
echo "   Code quality standards are enforced 📝"
echo ""

echo "Run 'make ci-setup' for detailed setup instructions"
